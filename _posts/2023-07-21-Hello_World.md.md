# Who is Farzahn?

TL:DR: Read the About page

## For everyone else:

My name is Farzahn Farange and I am an IT Systems Engineer currenlty working at Rover where "We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet". 

My partner Alex and I, have two pet babies Appa (Alaskan Klee Kai) and Momo (Flame Point Siamese) More about them later on. 

### My Two Chonky Bois

#### Appa
Appa is my six year old chonky Alaskan Klee Kai. He has been in our famaily since he was just 7 weeks and currently lives with my parents (more on why below).

#### Momo
Momo (aka Momiji) is my, equally chunky, six year old Flame Point Siamese. I met Momo when I met my partner, when he was just one year old.

Initially, my partner and I wanted to have both Appa and Momo in the same house. We researched ways to best introduce a dog and cat together, setup some safe areas to seperate them if needed, and scheduled the meeting days. Unfortunatly for Appa, Momo is extremly terretorial and was not happy having to share his space. [This is live footage of the first encounter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCZUHKUU8nY&t=123s)
