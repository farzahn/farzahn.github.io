# Who is he?

**TL;DR:** Read the [About](https://farzahn.com/about/) page.

## For everyone else:

My name is Farzahn Farange, and I am an IT Systems Engineer currently working at Rover, where "We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet."

My partner, Alex, and I have two pet babies: Appa (Alaskan Klee Kai) and Momo (Flame Point Siamese). More about them later on.

## My Two Chonky Bois

### Appa
Appa is my six-year-old chonky Alaskan Klee Kai. He has been in our family since he was just 7 weeks old and currently lives with my parents (more on why below).

### Momo
Momo (aka Momiji) is my equally chunky, six-year-old Flame Point Siamese. I met Momo when I met my partner, and he was just one year old.

Initially, my partner and I wanted to have both Appa and Momo in the same house. We researched ways to best introduce a dog and cat together, set up some safe areas to separate them if needed, and scheduled the meeting days. Unfortunately for Appa, Momo is extremely territorial and was not happy having to share his space. [This is live footage of the first encounter.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCZUHKUU8nY&t=125s)
